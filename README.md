The code from the game ActionSpaceTraveler ( https://cocanard.itch.io/action-space-traveler ) I decided to publish now that the game itself is basically dead and has been released 5 months ago.
It could give an idea of how the game work to anyone who is interested (also this could also for me be an argument, as the game is not code-signed, that this is not a malware).

I'm not gonna update this repo or the game, this project is completed and has no reason to be updated (also one of the reason why I published it).
Please be aware that some assets do not belongs to me (especially when it comes to sprites assets).
